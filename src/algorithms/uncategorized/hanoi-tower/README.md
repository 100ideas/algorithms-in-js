# Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanor (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas Tower) is a mathematical game or puzzle which consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod.

It all starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, making a canonical shape. The objective is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:

- Only one disk can be moved at a time
- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk

With `3` disks, the puzzle can be solved in `7` moves. The minimal number of moves required is `2^n - 1`, where `n` is the number of disks.
