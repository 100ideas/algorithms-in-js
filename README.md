## Complexity

The complexity of a data structure can be seen as a way of expressing their advantages and disadvantages easily, according to a specifig problem.

* *the space*: space complexity represents the memory consumption of a data structure. You'll generally need to trade some time for space or the other way around.
* *the time*: you need to express the complexity for several operations you can do with a data structure (i.e. adding, deleting, accessing)

Complexity is usually expressed with the [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation). Here's a summary of the [complexity of some famous data structures and sorting algorithms](http://bigocheatsheet.com/).
