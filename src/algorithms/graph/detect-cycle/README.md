# Detect Cycle in Graphs

In graph theory, a **cycle** is a path of edges and vertices wherein a vertex is reachable from itself. There are several different types of cycles, e.g a **closed walk** and a **simple cycle**.

## Example

A graph with edges colored to illustrate **path** `H-A-B` (green), closed path or **walk with a repeated vertex** `B-D-E-F-D-C-B` (blue) and a **cycle with no repeated edge** or vertex `H-D-G-H` (red)
