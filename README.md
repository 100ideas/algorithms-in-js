# Data Structures & Algorithms

Collection of Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript, including several _puzzels_ from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).

Greatly inspired by [trekhleb's](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/) awesome repository.

Execute `npm test` to run tests (after `npm i`, to install all dependencies)

## Complexity

The complexity of a data structure can be seen as a way of expressing their advantages and disadvantages easily, according to a specifig problem.

- _the space_: space complexity represents the memory consumption of a data structure. You'll generally need to trade some time for space or the other way around.
- _the time_: you need to express the complexity for several operations you can do with a data structure (i.e. adding, deleting, accessing)

Complexity is usually expressed with the [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation). Here's a summary of the [complexity of some famous data structures and sorting algorithms](http://bigocheatsheet.com/).
