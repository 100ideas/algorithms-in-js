# Linked List

Is a linear collection of data delements in which the order is not given by their physical placement in memory but, instead, because each elements points to the next.

This data structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence, during iteration. A drawback is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Fast random access is not feasible.

Complexity:

* access O(n)
* search O(n)
* insertion O(1)
* deletion O(1)

Inserting and deletion is O(n), if we don't separate it the access operation.
