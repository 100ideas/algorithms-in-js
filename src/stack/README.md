# Stack

A stack is an abstract data type that serves a collection of elements with two main operations:

* **push**, which adds an element to the collection
* **pop**, which removes the most recent added element

Stack operations follow the LIFO pattern (last in, first out). Aditionally, a peek operation may give access to the top of the stack without modifying it.

The name _stack_ comes from the analogy of stacking physical itemson top of each other, which makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the stack may require taking off multiple other items.

Complexity:

* access O(n)
* search O(n)
* insertion O(1)
* deletion O(1)

Simple representation of a stack runtime with push and pop operations.
