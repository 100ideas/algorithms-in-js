# Graph

A _graph_ is an abstract data type meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from mathematics.

It consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes, together with a set of unordered pairs of vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.
