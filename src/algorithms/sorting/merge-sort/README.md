# Merge Sort

Is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means it preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. It's a divide and conquer algorithm invented by John von Neumann in 1945.

This algorithm first divides the list into the smallest unit (1 element), then compares each element with the adjacent list to sort and merge the two adjacent lists. Finally all elements are sorted and merged.

These are the steps a human would take to emulate merge sort:
